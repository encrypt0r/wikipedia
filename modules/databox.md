# Databox
[Databox](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Module:Databox) is a Lua module used in a number of wikipedias to automatically crate infoboxes from Wikidata. You can use it via [this template](https://ckb.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%DA%95%DB%8E%DA%98%DB%95:Databox).

## Concerns/TODO
 - How stable is this? Will it last more than 20 years?
 - Can we override some of the values? Sometimes, there is no singular answer for a fact. Example: Nationality of some of the famous people.
 - Can we blacklist values for an individual infobox? (Related to above point)
 - Can we make it so that it doesn't show fields that are not translated?
